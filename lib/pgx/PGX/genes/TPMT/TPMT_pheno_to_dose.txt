Azathioprine/ Mercaptopurine/ Thioguanine	Thiopurines, immunosuppressants	TPMT Intermediate metabolizer	Decrease dosage of thiopurines	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries one functional and one non-functional copy of TPMT. Patients with this genotype typically require decreased doses of thiopurines.	Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) inactivates the thiopurine prodrugs (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and thioguanine), reducing their conversion to active, and toxic, thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Individuals who inherit two nonfunctional TPMT alleles are at 100% risk for life-threatening myelosuppression, due to high TGNs, if they receive chronic therapy with conventional doses of MP (or azathioprine). Despite having higher TGNs than wild-type homozygotes, only ~30-60% of patients who are heterozygous for TPMT are unable to tolerate full doses of MP or azathioprine (Relling_2011).

Azathioprine/ Mercaptopurine/ Thioguanine	Thiopurines, immunosuppressants	TPMT Poor metabolizer	Greatly decrease dosage of thiopurines or consider alternative drug	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries two non-functional copies of TPMT. Patients with this genotype typically require greatly decreased doses of thiopurines or should consider alternative drugs, as they may experience life-threatening myelosuppression with standard doses.	Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) inactivates the thiopurine prodrugs (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and thioguanine), reducing their conversion to active, and toxic, thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites.

Azathioprine/ Mercaptopurine/ Thioguanine	Thiopurines, immunosuppressants	TPMT Intermediate metabolizer or Poor metabolizer	Decrease dosage of thiopurines or consider alternative drug	ATYPICAL	This test cannot distinguish between TPMT *1/*3A (intermediate metabolizer) and *3B/*3C (poor metabolizer), however *3B/*3C is rare. Phenotypic testing is available to distinguish between these alleles.
