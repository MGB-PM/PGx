Drug	Drug Class or Action	Phenotype	Dosage Information	Category	Interpretation	Notes	References
Azathioprine	Thiopurine, immunosuppressant	NUDT15 Decreased function	Decrease dosage of thiopurines.	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries one functional and one low-function copy of NUDT15. Patients with this genotype typically require decreased doses of thiopurines. They may be at increased risk of developing leukopenia, neutropenia or alopecia with standard doses.	Autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often treated with thiopurine therapy. Leukopenia, neutropenia and alopecia are possible adverse effects. While other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's risk for these adverse effects, variants in TPMT and NUDT15 have been found that increase a patient's risk. The rs116855232 NUDT15 risk allele is more common in patients of Asian ancestry.  Additional information can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA134963132/clinicalAnnotation/1184514050. Note that a CPIC guideline is in progress, but not yet available, for NUDT15 and thiopurines.	Yang_2014
Azathioprine	Thiopurine, immunosuppressant	NUDT15 Poor function	Greatly decrease dosage of thiopurines or consider alternative drug.	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries two low-function copies of NUDT15. Patients with this genotype typically require greatly decreased doses of thiopurines or should consider alternative drugs, as they may develop leukopenia, neutropenia or alopecia with standard doses.
