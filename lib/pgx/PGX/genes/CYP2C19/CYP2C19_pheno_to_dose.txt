Amitriptyline/ Clomipramine/Doxepin/Imipramine/Trimipramine	Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)	CYP2C19 Normal metabolizer	Standard dosage of tertiary amines	STANDARD			
Amitriptyline/ Clomipramine/Doxepin/Imipramine/Trimipramine	Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)	CYP2C19 Rapid metabolizer	Consider use of alternative drug	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries one copy of an increased function allele and one copy of a normal function allele of CYP2C19, predicting rapid metabolizer status for CYP2C19 substrates. Consider selecting an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19, or if a tertiary amine is warranted, utilize therapeutic drug monitoring.	The CPIC guidelines for TCAs include the genes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression. (Dosing recommendations for neuropathic pain treatment with lower doses can be found in the text of Hicks_2016.) CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 poor or (ultra)rapid metabolizers may have an increased risk of treatment failure or side effects. Table 3 of Hicks_2016 provides recommendations for TCAs based on CYP2C19 diplotypes in the absence of CYP2D6. For amitriptyline, combined interpretation for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 is also provided in Table 4 of Hicks_2016 and in this report. Tricyclic antidepressants have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, so it may be reasonable to apply the CPIC guideline for amitriptyline and CYP2C19, CYP2D6 to other tertiary amine tricyclics including clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine.

Select an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19, or if a tertiary amine is warranted, significantly decrease dosage of amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, or trimipramine, and utilize therapeutic drug monitoring.

Citalopram/Escitalopram	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)	CYP2C19 Normal metabolizer	Standard dosage of citalopram or escitalopram	STANDARD			
Citalopram/Escitalopram	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)	CYP2C19 Rapid metabolizer	Consider use of alternative drug	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries one copy of an increased function allele and one copy of a normal function allele of CYP2C19, predicting rapid metabolizer status for CYP2C19 substrates. Lower plasma concentrations will increase probability of treatment failure with escitalopram or citalopram. Patients with this genotype should consider an alternative  drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19.	Citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline are extensively metabolized by CYP2C19. Variation in CYP2C19 activity may alter treatment efficacy and risk of side effects, for example increased risk of QT prolongation in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.

Clopidogrel	Antiplatelet	CYP2C19 Rapid metabolizer	Standard dosage of clopidogrel	STANDARD			
Clopidogrel	Antiplatelet	CYP2C19 Intermediate metabolizer	Use alternative drug	ATYPICAL	This result indicates that the patient carries one copy of a normal function allele and one copy of a no function allele of CYP2C19, or one increased function allele and one no function allele of CYP2C19, predicting intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2C19 substrates. Patients with this genotype are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events in response to clopidogrel. Use of an alternative antiplatelet drug is recommended.	The cytochrome P450-2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme contributes to the metabolism of many drugs, including clopidogrel. CYP2C19 is highly polymorphic, and alleles have been identified that have normal, increased, or decreased function. Among clopidogrel treated patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CYP2C19 intermediate or poor metabolizers may be at increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events.
